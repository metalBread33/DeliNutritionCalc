# Unofficial Publix Deli Nutritional Calculator

## Description
As someone who is on a weight loss journey, tracking calories and macronutrients is something that I take very seriously. However, Publix does not have an efficient and easy way to track items in the deli. While it may be easy to track the sliced meats and cheeses, other items such as subs and meals from the hotcase become tedious to track. The goal of this application is to provide Publix shoppers with an easy and effective way of tracking the calories, macronutrients, and important micronutrients (such as transfat and sodium) of all of their deli items. This project will be a web application using the .NET framework that users will be able to log into from any device. I will use Blazor as the frontend framework and C# for the backend. I will host the application on an AZURE server.
Throughout this project, I hope to learn more about how the .NET framework works, how to host an application on AZURE, and how to use Blazor.
